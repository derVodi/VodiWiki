# VodiWiki

## Abstract

VodiWiki is self contained wiki in a monolithic HTML file. This means the reader, the editor and the content is all in the very same file which can easily be put an an USB stick or published on a web site.

## Origin & Motivation

VodiWiki is based on TiddliWiki 2.8.1 by [Jeremy Ruston](https://github.com/Jermolene). A [new generation of TiddliWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is still maintained by a large community. The motivation to create a separate product (instead of participating the community) is that I want to go in a different direction: Less customizability, more simplicity in use.

## Working With The Source Code

* Just clone/download - the index.html can right be started in any browser
* Referenced JS files are structured in problem domain specific directories (like "Saving")
* There is "MyLinker.cs" which does nothing but packing the HTML + JS files into a monolithic HTML file
