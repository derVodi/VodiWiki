# VodiWiki

## Abstract

VodiWiki is self contained wiki in a monolithic HTML file. 
This means the reader, the editor and the content is all in the very same file which 
can easily be put an an USB stick or published on a web site.

## Origin & Motivation

VodiWiki is a branch of TiddliWiki 2.8.1 by [Jeremy Ruston](https://github.com/Jermolene). A [new generation of TiddliWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is still maintained by a large community.
The motivation to create a separate product (instead of participating the community) is a different focus. 
While the original product has a very own UX philosophy and is very customizable, VodiWiki focuses on "regular" end users and tries to mimic well known UX paradigms from other wikis / notes taking apps.
